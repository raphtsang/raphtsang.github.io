            <p class="aos">
                <em>
                    Furniture Galore is a Melbourne-based furniture store with four retail stores around the city. Given their focus on in-person sales, 
                    their website has been neglected, and although the website appears to have a quite contemporary and up-to-date design, there are many 
                    inconsistencies in the design that ruin the initially pleasing aesthetic of the site.
                </em>
                <br><br>
                In fact, perhaps due to combining factors of their badly designed online image and the recent pandemic, the site informed visitors of a 
                closing down sale at the end of the short 12-week span of this project, and is now officially closed. An archived version of the website can be seen here.

                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    The goal of this project is to redesign Furniture Galore's website to provide users with a much smoother and more enjoyable experience. The main problems are:
                    <br><br>
                    1. Many inconsistencies in design ruins the initially pleasing aesthetic of the website. <br>
                    2. Ambiguities and dark patterns can cause a lot of confusion and easily creates traps for users. <br>
                    3. Alignment and spacing quite bad, with sections of menu being hard to reach, as well as causing illegibility in some areas and misinformation. <br>
                    4. Unnecessary information is highlighted, and important information is less visible. <br>
                    5. Misleading menu and submenu categories that contain no products.

            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                The analysis of the original Furniture Galore website was carried out alongside 3 other websites, totalling 2 good and 2 bad websites. 
                While the other bad site appeared more flawed, after more in depth analysis Furniture Galore revealed itself to be riddled with problems 
                and inconsistencies, and was thus chosen to be the website to redesign and implement for the project.
                <br><br>
                The constant use of bold, red text on the images on the homepage evokes a mood of urgency unsuited for the rest of the quite modern 
                design of the website. Being targeted towards the general furniture market, the website falls a bit short. Many categories shown in the 
                menus and submenus don't actually contain any products, misleading the customer into thinking the company has more to offer than they do, 
                and the overall lack of attention to detail in the design and layout of the website creates an overall disharmony that is sure to turn 
                many potential customers away.

            <p>
                Wireframing was a crucial part to the redesign of the website. The layout and information hierarchy of the website was initially flawed, 
                and the iterative process of wireframing and sketching allowed for inspiration to be taken from good examples, creating for a more 
                structured and refined final layout and website.

            <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <p>
                Next, a design aesthetic and language had to be curated for the redesigned website. An inspiration board was created, 
                and elements were taken to create 3 fairly different variations of a potential design style for the website. In the 
                end, the third variation was chosen, as the font family chosen gives it a bit of character while remaining readable 
                at weights and sizes, and the overall round aesthetic makes this design the most welcoming, while also remaining 
                contemporary and true to the brand. The slight gradient is also part of the reason for choosing this design, as it 
                adds a bit of 3D dimensionality to the site without relying on drop shadows, and also provides a unique aesthetic, 
                differentiating itself from other sites. Overall, the final design balances both form and function, making it the 
                perfect choice for the redesign.

                <p>
                    A high-fidelity, interactive mockup was made next. Using Adobe XD, mockups of both the desktop and mobile versions of the redesign 
                    were created, complete with interactions and animations, making for an almost fully interactive mockup. These were then further 
                    self critiqued, before further refined and implemented into the final HTML, CSS, Javascript website.

                <em>
                    The original Furniture Galore website was tacky,
                    dysfunctional, and contained a lot of visual and
                    interactive inconsistencies. I feel through the redesign
                    of the website, I have managed to take away this
                    tackiness, and have unified the design language of the
                    site. 
                </em>
                <br><br>
                While the original website appeared contemporary,
                it felt like a generic modern website template which had
                little character. I feel my design has not only improved
                its usability by eradicating bugs and ambiguities, but
                has also breathed new life into the brand by giving it a
                new design aesthetic that can be unique to the brand.
