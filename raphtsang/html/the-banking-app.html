                <em>
                    the banking app. is a banking application designed and catered towards parents of international students and international students. 
                    The purpose of creating this application is to provide an older generation of parents ranging from 40-65 years old with a simple and 
                    easy to use mobile banking experience. 
                </em>
                <br><br>
                In line with the recent COVID-19 pandemic, many people were under lockdown and could not leave their homes. Due to the intimidating 
                and complicated nature of existing banking apps, older people such as parents of international students may be unfamiliar with them, 
                or perhaps be reluctant to use them. Having to send money over to their childrens' school fees and living expenses, our banking app 
                would be able to make their lives easier by utilizing a clear and user friendly interface.
            </p>

                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    Apart from its main functionality, which is to pay overseas school fees directly from the app, tba. also focuses on regular global transactions, 
                    local transactions, and transactions between accounts under the same name. It also has functions commonly found in banking apps, such as checking 
                    account balance, changing account settings app settings, and others.
                    <br><br>
                    Furthermore, transactions are among the most mentioned words seen in negative reviews on existing banking apps, showing clearly that apps 
                    available on the market do not do a good enough job of making their transactions easy to use. Our app will aim to eradicate as many of these 
                    concerns and dissatisfaction with transactions on mobile banking as possible.

            <h3 class="aos">Screenflows + Sketches</h3>
            <p class="aos">
                First, a screenflow of the potential screens of the application was put together. This includes key features, basic functions, and 
                how users will interact with the application. The flow of the application and the connection from screen to screen was detailed 
                through a mindmap like structure.
                <br><br>
                A series of rough and high-fidelity sketches were then made of the application, where we could gauge a general idea of the look and 
                layout of the application without having to spend too much time mulling over details.
                <br><br>
                In the high-fidelity sketches, a more complex and complete design of the screens were produced, where potential images, colours, and 
                shapes and placing of buttons were considered.

            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                The analysis of the original Furniture Galore website was carried out alongside 3 other websites, totalling 2 good and 2 bad websites. 
                While the other bad site appeared more flawed, after more in depth analysis Furniture Galore revealed itself to be riddled with problems 
                and inconsistencies, and was thus chosen to be the website to redesign and implement for the project.
                <br><br>
                The constant use of bold, red text on the images on the homepage evokes a mood of urgency unsuited for the rest of the quite modern 
                design of the website. Being targeted towards the general furniture market, the website falls a bit short. Many categories shown in the 
                menus and submenus don't actually contain any products, misleading the customer into thinking the company has more to offer than they do, 
                and the overall lack of attention to detail in the design and layout of the website creates an overall disharmony that is sure to turn 
                many potential customers away.
            </p>

            <p>
                Wireframing was a crucial part to the redesign of the website. The layout and information hierarchy of the website was initially flawed, 
                and the iterative process of wireframing and sketching allowed for inspiration to be taken from good examples, creating for a more 
                structured and refined final layout and website.

        <div class="cont-four-img-accross">
            <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <p>
                Next, a design aesthetic and language had to be curated for the redesigned website. An inspiration board was created, 
                and elements were taken to create 3 fairly different variations of a potential design style for the website. In the 
                end, the third variation was chosen, as the font family chosen gives it a bit of character while remaining readable 
                at weights and sizes, and the overall round aesthetic makes this design the most welcoming, while also remaining 
                contemporary and true to the brand. The slight gradient is also part of the reason for choosing this design, as it 
                adds a bit of 3D dimensionality to the site without relying on drop shadows, and also provides a unique aesthetic, 
                differentiating itself from other sites. Overall, the final design balances both form and function, making it the 
                perfect choice for the redesign.

                <h3>Interactive Mockup</h3>
                <p>
                    A high-fidelity, interactive mockup was made next. Using Adobe XD, mockups of both the desktop and mobile versions of the redesign 
                    were created, complete with interactions and animations, making for an almost fully interactive mockup. These were then further 
                    self critiqued, before further refined and implemented into the final HTML, CSS, Javascript website.

                <em>
                    The original Furniture Galore website was tacky,
                    dysfunctional, and contained a lot of visual and
                    interactive inconsistencies. I feel through the redesign
                    of the website, I have managed to take away this
                    tackiness, and have unified the design language of the
                    site. 
                </em>
                <br><br>
                While the original website appeared contemporary,
                it felt like a generic modern website template which had
                little character. I feel my design has not only improved
                its usability by eradicating bugs and ambiguities, but
                has also breathed new life into the brand by giving it a
                new design aesthetic that can be unique to the brand.
