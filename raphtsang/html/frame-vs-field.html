                <em>
                    Modelling the University of Melbourne's Old Quad, the final compositions of Frame vs. Field involved the abstract reinvention 
                    of its elements in order to tell the story of two chosen quotes from Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities' City of Signs. 
                </em>
                <br><br>
                Characters and backdrops were also picked out and composited in order to immerse the audience into the new world created from the building 
                blocks of the historical UniMelb landmark. On top of the two perspectives rendered, the final deliverables also included an isometric 
                notation of the model we create, giving an overview of the interpreted narrative.
                <br><br>
                Frame vs. Field, the penultimate module of Foundations of Design: Representation, is a project that combines all the skills introduced 
                and refined in the previous modules. Combining theories of isometric projection, 3D modelling and rendering, and iterative design, 
                the project showcases my ability to represent abstract as well as tangible ideas through design.

                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    Tamara is the first City of Signs in Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities, and is a city no
                    one can really visit. Being a city of signs, Tamara is always covered by a series
                    of signs, which act as a thick façade that obscures the vision of the real Tamara.
                    In this sense, “you leave Tamara without having discovered it” as the authentic
                    Tamara hides behind the “signs” of the city.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the main themes of Tamara is the idea of representation and symbols.
                    These symbols are brought to the reader as objects within the city, with things
                    such as “halberds” that denote the barracks, and “the volumes of Averroes”
                    symbolising knowledge and learning. The idea that the value of objects lie in
                    what they symbolize, and not what they physically are themselves, is constant
                    throughout the extract.
                    <br><br>
                    Through the isometric notation and the two perspectives of this Module, the
                    fake, superficial Tamara is left behind in the first perspective where only signs
                    “of things that mean other things” are shown, and the real Tamara where the
                    contrasting sides of good and evil are being adopted by Tamara's citizens.

            <h3 class="aos">Isometric Field + Notations</h3>
            <p class="aos">
                In the isometric drawing, the entirety of the field of the scene is shown, accompanied by notations that guide the viewer through its 
                narrative which is otherwise unknown. The upper section is situated in an area where time stands still, notated by the time/temporal 
                threshold square, as the abrupt and defined edges symbolise the stoppage of time, as it is contained and concealed within the bounds 
                of the façade, while the lower section has time passing normally.
                <br><br>
                The drawing follows a traveller, Hermes, who ventures through the city, starting at the upper quad in front of the façade, making their 
                way through into the real Tamara, the lower quad, interrupted by areas of disturbance where the columns of the real Tamara are being 
                sucked into the upper quad, where they risk becoming signs and mere façades of the city of Tamara along the way.
                <br><br>
                The people of Tamara are also given three paths, one upwards, one straight ahead, and one downwards, paralleling choices of good, 
                neutral, and evil. This has also been portrayed in Perspective 2, where the three characters are each either basked in light, partially 
                in the light, and completely in the shadows, also showing the morality of the different characters and citizens of Tamara.

                <h3>Modelling the Old Quad</h3>
                <p>
                    After the initial modelling of the unmodified Old Quad, I was rather lost as to where to take it next. Even with the annotated extract, 
                    I was struggling to find a meaningful scene to model, and it wasn't until multiple conversations with multiple people such as my tutor 
                    and my friend that I was able to come up with a clearer vision of the perspectives.
                    <br><br>
                    My initial perspectives were quite underwhelming in terms of my modification of the model, though they were a start to my process of 
                    familiarising myself with how far I could alter the Old Quad model. Having said this, my initial perspectives were still the starting 
                    points of my final two perspectives, and some elements such as the Hermes character, and ceilings flying away, can still be seen.

                <h3>Iterative Process</h3>
                <p>
                    After I had a clear vision of what I wanted to model, I started developing my two perspectives. At this moment, I still had no idea 
                    where to go with the isometric, and just had my two perspectives split into two parts of the model.
                    <br><br>
                    Perhaps my favourite part of the modelling was the manipulation of the blocks, as I moved them around and used CageEdit to stretch 
                    and distort the shapes of the columns and whole sections of the Old Quad to my liking. The isometric view started to make more sense 
                    to me the more I developed my Perspective 1, as it made sense to have a connection between the two perspectives, which is where the 
                    blocks on the sides lead down to, as well as through the hole in the floor.
