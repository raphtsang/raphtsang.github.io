                    of its elements in order to tell the story of two chosen quotes from Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities' City of Signs. 
                </em>
                <br><br>
                Characters and backdrops were also picked out and composited in order to immerse the audience into the new world created from the building 
                blocks of the historical UniMelb landmark. On top of the two perspectives rendered, the final deliverables also included an isometric 
                notation of the model we create, giving an overview of the interpreted narrative.
                <br><br>
                Frame vs. Field, the penultimate module of Foundations of Design: Representation, is a project that combines all the skills introduced 
                and refined in the previous modules. Combining theories of isometric projection, 3D modelling and rendering, and iterative design, 
                the project showcases my ability to represent abstract as well as tangible ideas through design.

                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    Tamara is the first City of Signs in Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities, and is a city no
                    one can really visit. Being a city of signs, Tamara is always covered by a series
                    of signs, which act as a thick façade that obscures the vision of the real Tamara.
                    In this sense, “you leave Tamara without having discovered it” as the authentic
                    Tamara hides behind the “signs” of the city.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the main themes of Tamara is the idea of representation and symbols.
                    These symbols are brought to the reader as objects within the city, with things
                    such as “halberds” that denote the barracks, and “the volumes of Averroes”
                    symbolising knowledge and learning. The idea that the value of objects lie in
                    what they symbolize, and not what they physically are themselves, is constant
                    throughout the extract.
                    <br><br>
                    Through the isometric notation and the two perspectives of this Module, the
                    fake, superficial Tamara is left behind in the first perspective where only signs
                    “of things that mean other things” are shown, and the real Tamara where the
                    contrasting sides of good and evil are being adopted by Tamara's citizens.

                <h3>Modelling the Old Quad</h3>
                <p>
                    After the initial modelling of the unmodified Old Quad, I was rather lost as to where to take it next. Even with the annotated extract, 
                    I was struggling to find a meaningful scene to model, and it wasn't until multiple conversations with multiple people such as my tutor 
                    and my friend that I was able to come up with a clearer vision of the perspectives.
                    <br><br>
                    My initial perspectives were quite underwhelming in terms of my modification of the model, though they were a start to my process of 
                    familiarising myself with how far I could alter the Old Quad model. Having said this, my initial perspectives were still the starting 
                    points of my final two perspectives, and some elements such as the Hermes character, and ceilings flying away, can still be seen.

                <h3>Iterative Process</h3>
                <p>
                    After I had a clear vision of what I wanted to model, I started developing my two perspectives. At this moment, I still had no idea 
                    where to go with the isometric, and just had my two perspectives split into two parts of the model.
                    <br><br>
                    Perhaps my favourite part of the modelling was the manipulation of the blocks, as I moved them around and used CageEdit to stretch 
                    and distort the shapes of the columns and whole sections of the Old Quad to my liking. The isometric view started to make more sense 
                    to me the more I developed my Perspective 1, as it made sense to have a connection between the two perspectives, which is where the 
                    blocks on the sides lead down to, as well as through the hole in the floor.
                </p>
                <h3>Composition</h3>
                <p>
                    The composition of the two perspectives follow the golden ratio, as characters and objects are laid on the path that the golden 
                    spiral takes, as well as on the intersections of the different rectangles that make up the spiral. The pinnacle of the spiral is 
                    used as the main point of focus, and is aimed to convey the narrative of the perspective and of the city. In perspective one, the 
                    spiral starts at the traveller, Hermers, and the pinnacle is situated at the hole in the floor that shows the real Tamara underneath, 
                    suggesting that Hermes, as the God of Travel, wants to travel and see the real Tamara for himself.
                    <br><br>
                    In perspective two, the spiral of the golden ratio follows the descent of their morality into evil. Starting with a white dove, 
                    symbolizing hope and purity on the bright side of the perspective, the spiral journeys to the dark side, passing through the 
                    partially moral worshipper, on to the worshipper hidden behind the weeds within the shadows, and the black crow symbolizing evil and 
                    death, finally ending on the pinnacle of the spiral where stormy chaos stirs.

                <p class="aos">
                    In the isometric drawing, the entirety of the field of the scene is shown, accompanied by notations that guide the viewer through its 
                    narrative which is otherwise unknown. The upper section is situated in an area where time stands still, notated by the time/temporal 
                    threshold square, as the abrupt and defined edges symbolise the stoppage of time, as it is contained and concealed within the bounds 
                    of the façade, while the lower section has time passing normally.
                    <br><br>
                    The drawing follows a traveller, Hermes, who ventures through the city, starting at the upper quad in front of the façade, making their 
                    way through into the real Tamara, the lower quad, interrupted by areas of disturbance where the columns of the real Tamara are being 
                    sucked into the upper quad, where they risk becoming signs and mere façades of the city of Tamara along the way.
                    <br><br>
                    The people of Tamara are also given three paths, one upwards, one straight ahead, and one downwards, paralleling choices of good, 
                    neutral, and evil. This has also been portrayed in Perspective 2, where the three characters are each either basked in light, partially 
                    in the light, and completely in the shadows, also showing the morality of the different characters and citizens of Tamara.

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        <em>Perspective One</em> depicts the Tamara that all travellers see, the city that serves as a front to the true Tamara underneath, as 
                        seen through the hole in the floor tiles and the objects. The use of objects serve as the signs constantly mentioned throughout 
                        the extract, and are a common theme throughout the two perspectives, though Perspective One uses rather superficial and basic 
                        signs, depicting rather obvious meanings. This perspective is the result of the phrase “whatever it may contain or conceal”, 
                        as the city within the perspective is contained within the floors that curve inwards, encapsulating the fake city itself, and 
                        as it conceals the real city in the background.
                        <br><br>
                        The tension wash was chosen for the perspective, as the tension and resistance of the fake Tamara fighting to keep everything 
                        contained and concealed is a point that the perspective conveys about the narrative of the extract.
                        <br><br>

                    <p>
                        <em>Perspective Two</em> is an exclusive view that only us viewers are able to see, as it depicts the true Tamara that is almost always 
                        concealed by the signs of the fake Tamara. In this perspective, a temple within Tamara is seen, where three worshippers are 
                        situated, representing the people of the city. The differences in shadow and light connote the morality of the worshippers, as 
                        light symbolizes good, and shadow evil. The ceilings, pillars, and floors of the temple also help to show the contrast in 
                        atmposphere on the dark and light sides, as the dark side is falling, cracking, and breaking apart, while the light side remains 
                        fully intact and free of cracks.
                        <br><br>
                        The delirium wash was chosen for this perspective, helping convey the idea that the people praying to the wrong and evil gods 
                        have been tricked by the signs into becoming delusional worshippers.
