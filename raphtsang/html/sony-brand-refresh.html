                <em>
                    One of the 20th century's greatest, most influential innovations, Sony's
                    Walkman revolutionized the way we listen to music. 
                </em>
                <br><!-- <br> --> 
                    While technology has
                    greatly advanced since the conception of the original Walkman in 1979, having
                    such an iconic product to your company's name is something that should be
                    celebrated. This Sony brand refresh aims to bring the feeling of nostalgia to
                    those both young and old by reminding people of the famous Walkman through
                    the use of colour. 
                <!-- In line with the recent COVID-19 pandemic, many people were under lockdown and could not leave their homes. Due to the intimidating 
                and complicated nature of existing banking apps, older people such as parents of international students may be unfamiliar with them, 
                or perhaps be reluctant to use them. Having to send money over to their childrens' school fees and living expenses, our banking app 
                would be able to make their lives easier by utilizing a clear and user friendly interface. -->

                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    Apart from its main functionality, which is to pay overseas school fees directly from the app, tba. also focuses on regular global transactions, 
                    local transactions, and transactions between accounts under the same name. It also has functions commonly found in banking apps, such as checking 
                    account balance, changing account settings app settings, and others.
                    <br><br>
                    Furthermore, transactions are among the most mentioned words seen in negative reviews on existing banking apps, showing clearly that apps 
                    available on the market do not do a good enough job of making their transactions easy to use. Our app will aim to eradicate as many of these 
                    concerns and dissatisfaction with transactions on mobile banking as possible.

            <h3 class="aos">Screenflows + Sketches</h3>
            <p class="aos">
                First, a screenflow of the potential screens of the application was put together. This includes key features, basic functions, and 
                how users will interact with the application. The flow of the application and the connection from screen to screen was detailed 
                through a mindmap like structure.
                <br><br>
                A series of rough and high-fidelity sketches were then made of the application, where we could gauge a general idea of the look and 
                layout of the application without having to spend too much time mulling over details.
                <br><br>
                In the high-fidelity sketches, a more complex and complete design of the screens were produced, where potential images, colours, and 
                shapes and placing of buttons were considered.

                <h3>Wireframing</h3>
                <p>
                    Next, we moved on to Miro to create some quick wireframes. Through creating a wireframe of our app, we are able to get a general idea 
                    of the physical layout of our app, including points of interaction that our users will be able to utilize within the app. Our 
                    wireframe serves as a solid foundation for the structure of our app, as we developed a wide, horizontal prototype of what various 
                    screens of the app would look like in medium fidelity.
                    <br><br>
                    Given the fact that familiar systems have been found to be easier for users, especially for those of older age, to use, as identified 
                    in the first phase of this banking app project, we realise that using existing apps for reference would largely benefit our users in 
                    terms of the increasing their satisfaction using the app, as well as reduce the amount of time it takes to learn to use it, hence our 
                    decision to take inspiration from popular and well received apps such as HSBC and ANZ.

            <h3>Mockups</h3>
            <p>
                When we were happy with our progress on our wireframes, we moved on to creating Mockups of our app. Deciding on our final colour palette for the app, 
                we were able to define a consistent aesthetic for our app to suit its goal of being clear and straightforward for our users to navigate and interact with.

                <em>
                    The original Furniture Galore website was tacky,
                    dysfunctional, and contained a lot of visual and
                    interactive inconsistencies. I feel through the redesign
                    of the website, I have managed to take away this
                    tackiness, and have unified the design language of the
                    site. 
                </em>
                <br><br>
                While the original website appeared contemporary,
                it felt like a generic modern website template which had
                little character. I feel my design has not only improved
                its usability by eradicating bugs and ambiguities, but
                has also breathed new life into the brand by giving it a
                new design aesthetic that can be unique to the brand.
