                <em>
                    Mario has been in the most of my life, accompanying me as a video game that grew as I grew. This project challenged me 
                    to look at the familiar scenes of the Super Mario world, not as levels in a video game, but rather as elevations 
                    providing incomplete instructions for creating a three-dimensional, axonometric composition. 
                </em>
                <br><br>
                Axonometric projections are a form of drawing that maintains its consistency everywhere on the page, in all dimensions. Differing from 
                the traditional perspective drawing, the axonometric form utilizes vanishing point(s) situated beyond infinity, or rather it exercises no 
                vanishing point, essentially meaning works situated in this medium can go on forever, be endless, limitless. In this module, given the 
                task of connecting a pair of 2D elevations in a 3D point of view, the space in-between is left up to the imagination. However, the 
                axonometric medium also has other implications, such as the need for accuracy in angles and dimensions, and a consistency that needs to 
                be maintained from the interpretation of the 2D elevations to the 3D projection, where each of the six building blocks chosen must 
                correspond directly to each other.

                <p>
                    Two elevations were given for us to choose our six building blocks from, and to project these blocks onto our axonometric 
                    as a basis for constructing our Mario worlds. While in the past students have been given two elevations from the same Mario 
                    level, our class was given the opportunity to experiment with elevations from two different levels, giving us a larger 
                    variety of blocks and styles to choose from. I feel that this also gave my world a lot of life through the different colours 
                    and styles.

            <h3 class="aos">Building Blocks</h3>
            <p class="aos">
                While choosing the building blocks for my Mario World, I had my colour palette in mind and choose blocks that I felt would complement 
                each other well in terms of texture as well as colour. One of the main areas I sought to explore was the idea of translucency, as I 
                was captivated by the appearance of the blue coin in the elevation, and how it interacted with objects behind it. I was eager to try 
                to represent these unique properties in my composition, which lead me to choose the blue coin and water as part of my building blocks.
                <br><br>
                While developing the water and blue coin building blocks, there was a lot of room for experimentation with the translucent attributes. 
                Different combinations of transparency on different coloured layers was a constant trial and error process of producing the perfect 
                translucency of the overall objects.
                <br><br>
                I had a rather unconventional approach to this module, as I developed my building blocks in Illustrator very early in the process, 
                when I still only had a few lines on paper. Although it was initially just an impulsive and impatient choice to render the blocks 
                digitally first, I feel it has really helped me to visualize the final axonometric early on, and has given my world a direction to work 
                towards as I built and drew on paper.

                <h3>Colours + Shadows</h3>
                <p>
                    The addition of colour and shading was my favourite part of the module, as it really helped to bring the hand drawing to life, 
                    and added the sense of depth that the hand drawing lacked. Through colouring and shading, the different elements became increasing 
                    easy to differentiate, where the variation of light and dark colours helped to add depth to the composition changing the once flat 
                    and confusing hand-drawn linework into a lively 3-dimensional composition.
                    <br><br>
                    Adding shadows to the axonometric also played a large part in the believability of the world. Utilizing the drop shadow function 
                    and clipping masks in Illustrator, I was able to create many believable shadows and restrict them to relevant blocks. The shadows 
                    helped to convey a sense of depth, and elevated each element from a mere collection of colours into solid blocks with bearings 
                    and a place in the vast Mario World axonometric.
